    <h1>Welcome to the Irregular Verbs Trainer</h1>
    <p>This is a simple application designed to help learn and practice irregular verbs.</p>
    <p>It's possible to add new verbs and edit existing ones. You can choose between only practicing one, two or all three forms at the same time.
        There is a simple spaced repetition feature and on the list of verbs you can look up how well you know the forms for each.</p>
